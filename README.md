# callme
Call a phone number; Have a convosation with a bot with the selected langauge, get stats at the end of call. Emailed to UI.

I don't want to build a website or a dashboard. YAWN

## How it works.

Call a phone number, where that number has a number coralated to it.

Speech will be generated by Eleven labs.
Langauge generate by either mixtral or OpenAI.

OPENAI for prototyping.

## Why
Learning a language takes alot of effort and if you are unmotivated, personally, I will just not do it and never enter the app because I'm lazy. Instead, why not have a bot call you where you can have a quick 1-5 minute convosation and get your stats after.

This way you can really interact with the langauge.

Phone calling is kinda outdated, but I think it works really well for this usecase.
